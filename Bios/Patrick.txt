California born, Michigan educated, forged in the Arizona sun, and residing in Texas, Patrick is part of the all rookie lineup at VCARB this season.

A relatively new motorsports fan, Patrick has only been following F1 for two years and has just begun getting into other series such as IndyCar and NASCAR. He has enjoyed learning to sim and kart.

While his affinity for motorsports is rather new, his friendship with his VCARB partner is a decade old. Patrick and Brently lived across the hall from one another their freshman year of college and have been gaming, debating sports, and growing their friendship ever since.

Patrick has been overheard saying, "If at the end of the season there is nothing left for VCARB or I to fight for, I am ready to ruin Erick's chances at all costs."
