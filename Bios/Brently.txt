A true Michigan man, Brently is a hardcore Detroit sports fan. Rain or shine, he roots for the home team and never doubts this is their year. Besides his love for Detroit sports, he is a fan of Phoenix sports due to being from there originally. 

However, Brently's all time favorite sport is NASCAR. A staunch advocate of turning left, Brently loves all things oval racing. He is known for his love of Jeff Gordon and everything he did for the sport. Whether its Bristol, Daytona, or Michigan, he is tuned in for the action.

Brently makes up half of the all rookie lineup at VCARB this season. He has put up with Patrick for over a decade now and fondly remembers being a member of the Wombats intramural team together. The pair has been competing at some level together for a long time and they hope to keep racing together going forward.

Goals for the season include having a good time, putting it all out there, and shooting for a strong finish in the Constructor's Championship.
