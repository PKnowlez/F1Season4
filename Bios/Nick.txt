Nick was introduced to the world of Formula 1 around 1998-99 and began watching religiously in 2002. From the start he was a McLaren and Raikkonen fan, but he followed Kimi’s journey when he moved to Ferrari all the way to the end in 2018, where he watched Kimi’s final win live in Texas.

In 2006 Nick attended his first race live, in Canada. He was also in Canada for Lewis Hamilton’s first win in 2007, where he also witnessed Kubica’s famed accident in the hairpin.

Beyond F1, Nick enjoys WRC after following Raikkonen’s career there in 2009. Which brings us to Nick’s bucket list of races to attend, which includes F1 in Spa, WRC in Portugal, and The 24 Hours of Lemans. Nick had the fortune of shortening that list when he attended Silverstone this past season and saw Lewis Hamilton take home the victory in his final tour with Mercedes.

Not to date Nick, but he does remember watching F1 on Speed TV. He is also the 3-time reigning champion of The Alternative F1 league.
